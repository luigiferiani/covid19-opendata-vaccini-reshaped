# covid19-opendata-vaccini-reshaped
(Subset of) Data from https://github.com/italia/covid19-opendata-vaccini, reshaped for ease of use with Tableau Public

The data featured in this repo is taken from the original repo's `somministrazioni-vaccini-latest.csv`.

The spreadhseet has been split into three parts, containing the number of administered doses broken down either by sex, by "category", or by first/second dose.
This reshaping of the data makes it easier to connect to a Tableau Public visualisation, working around the limitations of the free Tableau version.
